# Beporsoft.Blazor.Charts

## Introduction
This is a Blazor library for creating charts in client, server and hybrid blazor projects. The library uses the [Chart.Js](https://www.chartjs.org/) package underneath, but it does not focus only on being a wrapper for blazor.

I started this project inspired by [ChartJs.Blazor](https://github.com/mariusmuntean/ChartJs.Blazor) that I used for a while. 
However, I found areas of improvement in the way the chart data and options are constructed. 
There are many Chart.Js options that are rarely used and many others that are a bit confusing to configure. 

The aforementioned project was abandoned long ago in an already previous version of Chart.Js and my purpose with this project is to learn from previous experience and give a new approach to chart rendering in Blazor.

This is my own interpretation of Chart.js for the most common use cases.
